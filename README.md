# Turtle - Food...Fast App - Client

## About this project

[Pivotal Tracker Project link](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2447118) 

It is a single page web application allowing the user to veiw a restaurant menu and add food to their cart.<br>
This is the client side app with the backend API created in Ruby on Rails in a separate [repo](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/slowfood-api-team-1-april-2020).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project also uses [Semantic UI for React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for styling.

The application's features are tested using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).<br>
